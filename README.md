1. When will you go for Automation Testing? 

Automation Testing is preferred when:
- to run tests faster
- Regression testing is required frequently
- Test cases are repetitive
- The project is long-term cost effective for huge projects 
- Multiple browsers need to be tested
- Avoid human errors 

2. Difference between driver.close() and driver.quit()

-> driver.close()
. Closes the current browser window
. WebDriver session remains active
. Used when multiple windows are open

-> driver.quit() 
. Closes all browser windows
. Ends the WebDriver session
. Used at the end of execution
